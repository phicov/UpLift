# UpLift

  The idea of this project comes from the need for support. Whether that support is for mental health, learning to do something new, meeting like-minded people, etc. People are better when they are together. With the goal of total optimism in mind, this project will be a great experience and a very helpful tool to those who are in need of such.
  
   The goal is to combine a forum-like app and a chat app. You will be able to make forums under a forum category and be able to comment under it. Full CRUD with creating, reading, updating, and deleting your own, and other's profiles. Also being able to messsage specific people and making group chats if possible.
